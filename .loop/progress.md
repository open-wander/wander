## Execution Log

### 2026-01-26 - Project Setup (Feature Parity)
- Created new task list with 70 tasks across 6 phases
- Previous UI modernization project marked complete (127/127 tasks)
- Key focus areas:
  1. ACL middleware (foundation for secure operations)
  2. API integration (replace mock data with real Nomad API)
  3. Write operations (job actions, variable CRUD, etc.)
  4. Missing pages (job submission, deployments)
  5. Real-time updates (polling, SSE)
  6. UX polish (keyboard shortcuts, search, error pages)
- Decided to keep current stack (HTMX + Alpine.js + Templ + Tailwind)
- No React/Vue migration needed - current architecture is sound

### 2026-01-26 - Task 1: ACL middleware for token extraction
- Added token extraction from X-Nomad-Token header and nomad_token cookie
- Header takes precedence over cookie (matches Nomad standard)
- Token stored in request context via typed contextKey
- Added helpers: GetTokenFromContext(), WithTokenContext(), GetTokenFromRequest()
- ACL middleware wired into router via wrapMiddleware()
- Added 4 test functions for all extraction scenarios
- Pattern: Non-validating middleware - just extracts, doesn't validate
- Files: context.go, middleware.go, middleware_test.go, router.go
